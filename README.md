# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a simple tic tac toe game a did while starting to study Python.
It is a very simple project just to start testing my Python skills.
Inside the notebook there are all of the instructions to play the game and how it works.

It is quite a bit hard-coded in certain parts as I just learned Python and don't know yet how to do some things more efficiently.

Thanks!
